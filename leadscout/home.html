					<h2>Get started in a few minutes</h2>
					<p>Sign up directly on our site. We will give
						you a small script that tracks your visitors.
						You simply have to add this directly to the

						people about how to do it.</p>

					<h2>See exactly who visits your site</h2>
					<p>You will be able to see which companies
						visit your website: which pages they view
						and when. Our algorithms match the

						give you all the details you need to get in
						touch with them.</p>

					<h2>Turn your traffic into quality leads</h2>
					<p>Use leadscout as a source of qualified
						leads for your salesforce. You will know
						which aspects of your product they are

						they visited.</p>

					<h3>The challenge of selling online</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>You have a great website. You do marketing and PR, and you have a form on your
						site that lets people sign up to be contacted.</p>
					<p>And yet you don’t see anywhere near the number of signups you expected.</p>
					<p>The problem is that less than 5% of the visitors to a site ever sign up. That does not
						mean that they are not interested in your product. It simply means that they weren’t
						sure enough that your product was right for them for them to take the time to put all
						their contact details into a form. After all, your prospects are busy people.</p>
					<p>What if you could identify exactly who these anonymous visitors are? Leadscout lets
						you do just that.</p>
